       " 'review': '**Review of Pizza Salami: A Disappointing Experience**\\n\\nI recently ordered Pizza Salami, and unfortunately, my experience was far from enjoyable. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, the delivery took an unexpectedly long time. When the pizza finally arrived, it was lukewarm at best. I understand that weekends can be busy, but this wait truly tested my patience.\\n\\nAs for the pizza itself, I was let down by the quality. The crust was soggy and lacked the crispiness I was hoping for. It felt more like a cardboard base than a freshly baked pizza. The salami, which should have been the star of the show, was overly oily and didnâ€™t pack the flavor punch I expected. Instead of enhancing the pizza, it seemed to drown it. \\n\\nAdditionally, the cheese was sparse and didnâ€™t melt properly. There was an off-putting taste that lingered, as if the ingredients were not fresh. I even found a few burnt edges, which is a cardinal sin for any pizza.\\n\\nOverall, my experience with Pizza Salami was disappointing. I had high hopes for a delicious meal, but it turned into an unpleasant ordeal. I wonâ€™t be ordering from this place again and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a satisfying pizza experience. ',\n",
       " 'comment': \"**Follow-Up Comment:**\\n\\nThank you for sharing your experience with Pizza Salami. It's always disappointing when a meal doesnâ€™t meet our expectations, especially when youâ€™re craving something specific like a good pizza. \\n\\nI agree that timely delivery and food quality are crucial for a positive experience. It's unfortunate that the pizza arrived lukewarm, and I can see how a soggy crust and bland toppings could ruin the entire dish. It sounds like there were multiple missed opportunities to make your meal enjoyable. \\n\\nIf you're still in the mood for pizza, maybe you could try a different place next time. There are so many options out there, and itâ€™s worth finding one that serves a pizza with a nice, crispy crust and fresh ingredients. Hopefully, your next pizza experience will be much more satisfying!\",\n",
