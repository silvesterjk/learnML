From start to finish, it was nothing short of awful.\\n\\nFirst off, the delivery was delayed by over 30 minutes, which is frustrating in itself. When the pizza finally arrived, it was lukewarm and lacked the fresh-out-of-the-oven quality that one hopes for when ordering pizza. \\n\\nOpening the box was my first letdown – the pizza was poorly assembled, with toppings sliding off the sides. The crust was chewy and devoid of flavor, leaving me longing for the crispy, golden edges I usually enjoy. As for the salami, it taste bland and greasy, lacking the richness and kick that makes it a go-to topping. \\n\\nMoreover, the sauce was overly sweet and didn’t complement the other ingredients at all. I found myself picking off the toppings just to salvage what little enjoyment I could from the dough beneath. \\n\\nOverall, the experience fell far short of expectations, and I left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated. I can’t recommend this Pizza Salami, as there are far better options out there. I won’t be returning for a second try. ',\n",

It's always disappointing when a meal doesn't meet expectations, especially when you're looking forward to enjoying it. It sounds like there were multiple issues, from the delivery time to the quality of the pizza itself. \\n\\nHave you considered reaching out to the restaurant to share your feedback? Sometimes they appreciate hearing from customers and may offer a remedy. Hopefully, they'll take your comments seriously and improve their service in the future. If you’re open to trying another place, I’d love to hear what pizza spots you have had good experiences with!\",\n",
