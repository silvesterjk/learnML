       " 'review': '**Review of Pizza Salami: A Disappointing Experience**\\n\\nI recently ordered a Pizza Salami, hoping for a delicious meal, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. \\n\\nFirst off, the pizza arrived later than expected. I understand that sometimes delays happen, but it would have been nice to receive an update or estimate on the delivery time. When it finally arrived, I was met with a soggy crust that reminded me more of cardboard than the crispy base I was hoping for. \\n\\nThe salami itself was a letdown as well. Instead of being flavorful and satisfying, it lacked any real taste and seemed stale. The balance of cheese and sauce was off; there was far too much sauce, making the entire pizza overly soggy and difficult to eat. I ended up picking off some of the toppings just to salvage the experience. \\n\\nLastly, the overall presentation was also disappointing. A pizza should be inviting, but this looked unappetizing and thrown together. \\n\\nSadly, I cannot recommend the Pizza Salami based on this experience. I believe every restaurant deserves a second chance, but this was not a good start. For now, I’ll be looking elsewhere for my pizza cravings.',\n",

It's always disappointing when a meal doesn't meet expectations, especially when you're looking forward to it. \\n\\nHave you considered reaching out to the restaurant to share your feedback? They might appreciate the insight and could potentially address the issues you encountered. It's always important for businesses to know when they’re not meeting their customers' expectations. I hope your next pizza outing is much better!\",\n",
