* Language AI, a field characterised by the development of systems capable of understanding and generating human language.
* Language AI encompass things that are beyond LLMs. Retrieval systems can boost the capabilities of LLMs can be considered as one.
* Bag-of-words was one of the first techniques. A method to represent unstructured text. Which starts with tokenisation, the process of splitting up the text into words/subwords.

Thoughts from the topic -- Will be added to [[Thoughts for Research]] :
1. Non playable characters (NPCs) have often been referred to as AI even though many are mere if-else statements. Huh! Interesting. 
2. Can we encode alphabets with tokens instead of 0 and 1s?
3. Can we use a local language encoder to up the performance of the model in languages the models are not trained on?
