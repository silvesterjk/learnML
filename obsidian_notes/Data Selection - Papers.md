* An optimal dataset is that which most closely matches the distribution which the model will be evaluated on.
* One of the data selection process can include selecting auxiliary samples that will most benefit the additional training signals for the target task.
* When the selection function assigns numbers between say 1 and 10, that is called data mixing. This helps to adjust dataset distribution.
