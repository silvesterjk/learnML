Typical Setting:

Task: Given Vertices and Edges, we need a function that takes V as inputs and outputs a real valued prediction for every node.

Node-level Tasks (Semi-Supervised)
![[Pasted image 20240703083717.png]]

Goal: Characterize the structure and position of a node in the network: 
▪ Node degree 
	- The degree *K*𝑣 of node 𝑣 is the number of edges (neighbouring nodes) the node has.
	- Treats all neighbouring nodes equally.

▪ Node centrality
	- Node degree counts the neighbouring nodes without capturing their importance. 
	- Node centrality *C*𝑣 takes the node importance in a graph into account
	- Different ways to model importance: 
		- Eigenvector centrality 
		- Betweenness centrality 
		- Closeness centrality
	- 

▪ Clustering coefficient 
▪ Graphlets
