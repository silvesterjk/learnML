* A set is a collection of unordered and yet distinct objects.
* Usually added inside `{ }`, these objects are called elements.
* `∈` -- Belongs & a striked through `/∈` -- Does not belong
	* If object ω belongs to set A, we say “ω belongs to A” and write ω ∈ A. 
	* Conversely, if ω is not in A, we write ω /∈ A.
* A set with a single elements is called a singleton
* A set with no elements are called a null set
* A set of all possible values is universal set
	* `B = { ω_1, ω_2,...,ω_n }` for example.
* We say that “A is a subset of B”, and write `A ⊆ B`
