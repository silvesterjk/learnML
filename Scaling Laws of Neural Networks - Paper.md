* Scaling laws of ML models are a function of number of model parameters, data size, and total compute used for training.
* Performance in mostly about avoiding bottlenecks
	* Not enough data
	* Not enough parameters
	* Not enough compute
* The compute law generalises to different data distributions such as: Math, multimodal, video, images etc.
